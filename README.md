# Data Analysis using SQL

This repository showcases a collection of SQL-based data analysis projects, demonstrating practical skills in extracting, transforming, and querying various datasets. Each project tackles specific analytical challenges, revealing key insights and patterns.

## Projects:

## [Employee Data Analytics]( https://github.com/Anandhi-Balu/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Employee%20Data%20Analytics)

This project involved a comprehensive analysis of an HR dataset using SQL to uncover key organizational insights. Key queries include detecting duplicate employee records, evaluating staffing levels by job title, and identifying departments without managers. Advanced SQL techniques such as **window function (RANK), CTEs,** and **date functions** were used to extract insights like top earners by department and employee service duration. 

## [Blinkit Sales Analysis](https://github.com/Anandhi-Balu/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Blinkit%20Sales%20Analysis)

Performed in-depth analysis of Blinkit's sales data to uncover key business insights. Key analyses included:

* Data Standardization: Cleaned and unified inconsistent product categories ("LF" → "Low Fat," "reg" → "Regular") to ensure accurate analysis. 
* Revenue Insights: Calculated total revenue (in millions), average revenue per sale, and total items sold, highlighting financial performance. 
* Sales Performance: Analyzed how fat content, item types, and outlet characteristics (location, age, and size) impact total sales. 
* Comprehensive Metrics: Delivered a comprehensive breakdown of key metrics (sales volume, average revenue, average customer rating) segmented by outlet type.
