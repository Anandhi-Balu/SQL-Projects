# Data Analysis using SQL

This repository showcases a collection of SQL-based data analysis projects, demonstrating practical skills in extracting, transforming, and querying various datasets. Each project tackles specific analytical challenges, revealing key insights and patterns.

## Projects:

### [Employee Data Analytics]( https://github.com/Anandhi-Balu/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Employee%20Data%20Analytics)

This project involved a comprehensive analysis of an HR dataset using SQL to uncover key organizational insights.
