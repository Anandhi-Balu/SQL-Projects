# Blinkit Sales Analysis

Tool used: MySQL Workbench

Performed in-depth analysis of Blinkit's sales data to uncover key business insights. Key analyses included:

* **Data Standardization**: Cleaned and unified inconsistent product categories ("LF" → "Low Fat," "reg" → "Regular") to ensure accurate analysis. 
* **Revenue Insights**: Calculated total revenue (in millions), average revenue per sale, and total items sold, highlighting financial performance. 
* **Sales Performance**: Analyzed how fat content, item types, and outlet characteristics (location, age, and size) impact total sales. 
* **Comprehensive Metrics**: Delivered a comprehensive breakdown of key metrics (sales volume, average revenue, average customer rating) segmented by outlet type.
